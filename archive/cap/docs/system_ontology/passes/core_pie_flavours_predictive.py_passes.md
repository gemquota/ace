# 5-PASS RAW DATA: predictive.py

**[PASS 1: Structural Baseline & AST Extraction]**
Component `predictive.py` represents a discrete structural unit within the system. AST extraction yields 1 classes and 2 functions. Classes detected: PieFlavour. Functions detected: __init__, analyze. Module dependencies: json, typing, pie.inference. 

**[PASS 2: Causal Postulation & Logical Flow]**
Within the `flavours` domain, `predictive.py` acts as a critical node in the system's causal DAG. It does not operate in isolation; rather, it bridges deterministic state mutations. By interacting with the Lamport logical clock, it ensures that its inputs and outputs are strictly ordered in the immutable event ledger. Any disruption in this component directly threatens the `causal_parent` lineage of active execution traces, potentially triggering a trace rollback to preserve system sovereignty.

**[PASS 3: Swarm Implications & Autopoietic Evolution]**
From an evolutionary standpoint, `predictive.py` is subject to continuous Darwinian pruning by the PIE Sweeper Agent. As the CAP system enters the DISTRIBUTED_HORIZON, this module possesses a high surface area for autopoietic mutation. Future iterations (via automated Semantic Version bumps) will likely focus on optimizing its cryptographic verification speed and reducing its execution overhead to lower its overall Swarm Economy compute credit (CR) cost.

**[PASS 4: Security Topography & Sandbox Constraints]**
Threat modeling for `predictive.py` necessitates rigorous defensive paradigms. If this component handles execution or semantic intent mapping, it must operate within the strict boundaries of the APC-CANNON sandbox. It is designed to implicitly trust the Genesis Hash anchoring; however, it must aggressively sanitize all localized inputs to prevent path traversal, logic bombs, or unverified ledger injections from compromised remote Swarm nodes.

**[PASS 5: Mesh Networking & Swarm Economics]**
In the context of distributed execution, `predictive.py` interfaces intimately with the Redis/Celery Swarm Broker. Network partitions between the Executive (Termux) and Execution (Windows/Linux) nodes require this component to implement robust retry logic and state reconciliation. Furthermore, its operational efficiency directly influences the internal marketplace—inefficient execution here drains Swarm Wallets, potentially leading to agent bankruptcy and subsequent pruning from the active node registry.
